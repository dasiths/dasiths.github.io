I am a multi skilled and experienced full stack .NET developer. I have been working with Microsoft technologies for more than a decade. During my career I have been exposed to the .NET stack and have acquired extensive experience in both front and back-end development.  These days I mostly utilize Azure and AWS offerings to design & deliver cloud based solutions.

In most of my development projects I employ an Agile method of development with emphasis on good design principles, manageable codebases and scalability. I strive to write clean, testable and reusable code.

After completing my Masters degree in 2009 I led the development of the best in class ERP software for hire, service and sales of earth moving equipment. Then I worked for one of the top trade printing companies in Australia, integrating and streamlining their printing process and building a B2B framework.
