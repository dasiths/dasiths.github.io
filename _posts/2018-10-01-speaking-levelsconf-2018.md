I recently got a chance to speak at <a href="https://www.levelsconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Levels Conference</a> and it was my first time speaking in front of such a large audience. There were around 400 very keen junior developers there.

The goal of the conference is to bring together the Developer community of Australia and beyond. They aim to give people a platform to share, grow and connect, regardless of experience level.

This was the inaugural running of the event organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/lukemesiti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Mesiti</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ljkenward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LJ Kenward </a>both of whom did an amazing job of making the event such a success. I had an awesome time networking and meeting junior developers of all ages and backgrounds. It certainly inspired me to get more involved in the community.

My talk was about Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation. I introduced the concepts and gave examples of how ES has been solving our problems for a long time before software engineering was a thing. I also spoke a bit about the kind of problems we can apply ES + CQRS to.

The abstract is as follows.
