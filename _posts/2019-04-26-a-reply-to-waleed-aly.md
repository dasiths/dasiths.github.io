Hello everyone. 

I don't often get too attached to comments made by these celebrity tv show hosts but the article seemed so dishonest and apologetic and I wanted to jot down some words. I doubt Waleed will ever get to read this but at least it's now in the ether. I wanted to apologize for bringing politics into my blog but then it dawned on me that one shouldn't merely apologize for pointing out the fallacy or a argument made by someone else regardless of it being political or not.

## Dear Waleed,

I have just finished reading your article (https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/the-sri-lankan-attacks-are-uniquely-senseless-20190425-p51h2v.html) on the Sydney Morning Herald and I can now understand why it has left such a bitter taste in the mouth of most Sri Lankans including myself. Your narrative seems passive aggressive and at times hypocritical when seen in the context of the recent Christchurch attacks.

To quote you, 
> Name a terrorist attack, and you can typically understand its narrative in those linear terms. But that is not true here.

I can empathize with you and understand your point of view as someone looking outside in. Your meta perspective misses some crucial details of the political situation in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately this has been a growing trend among many international reporters who seem to live their own echo chambers. Let my try to give you a perspective of a Sri Lankan.

Before I do so, I want to correct a few fallacies that you have subtlety implanted on your reader. For your sake I hope these are honest mistakes and not attempts to subdue facts that don‚Äôt fit your narrative.

You say `"Sri Lanka is a country with no real history of Muslim-Christian tension"` but your threshold for `"real history"` seem to be much lower when it comes to `"post-civil war persecution"` the hands of the Buddhist nationalist right wing extremist. The truth is both of these things you‚Äôve mentioned have happened. Although Sri Lanka is a multi-cultural, multi-race and multi-religious, apart from some major cities the other parts of the country fit the description of many tribes tolerating each other closely than a melting pot. The middle class don‚Äôt have the privilege to do anything other than to struggle for their survival. In this environment, mistrust and anger can easily be directed towards other races or religions. It doesn‚Äôt help that the politicians use this to polarize people based on identity politics. Rather than vote based on class structures, Sri Lankans‚Äô voting patterns have been based on race for 50+ years. But I digress. In this environment tensions between certain communities are not unexpected. Having said that I would argue that the Muslim population in Sri Lanka have it better than most other places in the world where they are the minority. They aren‚Äôt seen as 2nd class citizens and even our defence forces have a big presence of Muslims. The tensions I spoke of have boiled over a handful of times post-war though. Each time the countries leaders and prominent figures have stressed the importance of unity and the vast majority of people don‚Äôt want to entertain ideas of another civil war. Once burnt as they say. 

The crux of your argument seems to be that is `‚Äúsenseless‚Äù` because the attacks were against the Christians/Catholics. You **passive aggressively** hint that it wouldn‚Äôt be so senseless (or to understand the motive) if the attacks were against the Buddhists. Let‚Äôs examine your claim more closely. 

It‚Äôs easy to claim that the Islam extremist ideology is home grown since all the suicide bombers were born in Sri Lanka. This misses a crucial point though. Sri Lankan Muslims have had their own cultural identity compared to every other Muslim community in the world. Some of them even identify themselves as Sinhalese. They were moderately religious (compared to other countries) and enjoy the same freedoms others cultures in Sri Lanka do. The extremist elements that have ONLY started to pop up in the last decade have been as result of direct influences from middle eastern countries to promote a brand of [Wahabism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism) in the Muslim communities. There has been strong opposition to this by liberal Muslim commentators. This brand of Islamists carried with the same resentments of the middle east towards western culture. They hate the westernisation of Sri Lanka and see efforts of progressives as an attack on Islam. If anything, they share this with Sinhalese Buddhist Right wing who also HATE western influences. It is no surprise that the extremist Muslim elements see western cultures and faiths as their main target in this context. 

It‚Äôs a matter of what they hate more. It is well documented that terrorist‚Äôs motives are more political than religious ([Mehdi Hasan uses this argument many times](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/29/you-shouldnt-blame-islam-for-terrorism-religion-isnt-a-crucial-factor-in-attacks/)). This is even true for ISIS and Al-Qaeda even though people identify these groups with Islam more than their political beliefs. The linchpin in the Easter Sunday attacks had gone public with his declaration of war against all things western including the people who live in those countries. Including you and me.

Sri Lankan Christians and Catholics are not `‚Äúartificial‚Äù` `‚Äúsymbols of Western-ness‚Äù` as you like us believe. Sri Lanka was colonized by western powers and they converted most low land people into their faith. They were considered closer to the ruling western powers than the Buddhists. This though, admittingly an idiotic belief still hangs on among people. I can understand why you fail to see this as this requires an intricate understanding of the Sri Lankan history and culture.

Given this, do you think it was senseless that they targeted the Christian faith (The beacon faith of the western society) and foreign nationals?

 It makes PERFECT sense (From the perspective of the terrorist of course). That‚Äôs why your statement `‚Äú‚Ä¶ the obvious target of such groups would-be Buddhists. The idea that a Sri Lankan Islamist group would choose specifically to target Christians makes no sense in the way terrorist attacks usually do‚Äù` doesn‚Äôt hold water. You‚Äôre right, Sri Lanka has had an increase of incidents where Muslims were harassed but you‚Äôre reaching when you say `‚ÄúThat Muslim radicalisation might emerge from this environment is easy enough to imagine‚Äù`. The fact that the Muslim extremists hate the western influence and ideology more than this glorified hatred from Buddhists, is case and point if you needed further evidence. It‚Äôs only senseless if you‚Äôre looking for a reason that doesn‚Äôt exist. Muslims aren‚Äôt (weren‚Äôt) persecuted in Sri Lanka to the extent you have your readers believe. As a progressive person I can not tolerate any amount of persecution of a minority group but what I can also not tolerate is hyperbole and playing the victim card when it is not warranted.

I am trying my best to see past the irony of this last statement of yours when applied against the context of the Christchurch massacre. Your apologetic tone was the same one the alt-right used to ‚Äú*explain*‚Äù the emergence of toxic white nationalism. Maybe you should think about that for a bit.

P.S. I would consider myself left in the spectrum of political beliefs but I have a strong distaste dishonest reporting because how the far right and the liberal left use incidents like the one in Sri Lanka to play the identify politics game. The only request I make is that you be objective in your assessment and be provide a more nuanced perspective when you get the opportunity to discuss this further. Sri Lankan history is well publicised and you can get narratives from many ends of the political spectrum. If not anything, maybe try to get the full picture before you fall into the same trap again.

Thank you,

A Triggered Sri Lankan üòä
